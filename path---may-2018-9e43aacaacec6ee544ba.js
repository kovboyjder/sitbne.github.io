Using rapid prototyping, designers are able to incorporate user feedback, and refine functionality before any development begins; allowing developers to spend more time on quality. For companies heavily invested in SAP, it is worth considering product specific prototyping tools, such as SAP Build. The more focused scope of Build offers a number of advantages over general prototyping tools, with a lot of the leg work being automated or guided. For us, this meant that prototypes could be completed within a day of the initial discussion, and end users\' feedback could be incorporated quickly and easily.</p>\n<p>Lachlan Magee will discuss and demonstrate some of these capabilities of SAP Build.</p>\n<h2 id="session-2-demystifying-the-art-of-component-reuse-in-sapui5"><a href="#session-2-demystifying-the-art-of-component-reuse-in-sapui5" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Session 2: Demystifying the art of component reuse in SAPUI5</h2>\n<p>One of the things I’ve always found being really complex was component reuse. This means to use one app inside another. In this discussion, I (Jakob Kjaer) will try my best to demystify this, as it really isn’t that hard at all.</p>\n<h2 id="session-3-to-be-announced-shortly"><a href="#session-3-to-be-announced-shortly" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Session 3: To be announced shortly</h2>\n<p>We have a really great speaker lined up and they are finalising their topic of choice.   </p>',timeToRead:1,excerpt:"In this session we plan to have three speakers discuss the topics from SAPUI5, SAP Build and one more topic soon to be finalised by a guest…",frontmatter:{title:"May 2018",cover:"../images/Brisbane-Logo-Wheel-City.jpg",date:"2018-05-31",category:"tech",tags:["SAPUI5","SAP Build"],author:"jorg"},fields:{slug:"/may-2018"}},prev:{excerpt:"Get in touch with us We'd love to hear from you if you are keen to share something with the community.
